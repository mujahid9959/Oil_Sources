        <tr>
            <td>Post-Harvest Processing</td>
            <td>
                After harvesting, avocados can be stored in controlled environments to extend shelf life. Ripening can be accelerated by storing them at room temperature.

        <tr>
            <td>Environmental Impact</td>
            <td>
                Avocado trees can improve soil health and provide habitat for wildlife. However, over-cultivation can lead to deforestation and water resource depletion in some regions.

        <tr>
            <td>Storage and Shelf Life</td>

<div class="section-title">Total Revenue (including by-products):</div>
