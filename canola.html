        <tr>
            <td>Harvesting Method</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Market Demand</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Environmental Impact</td>
            <td>Canola helps improve soil health and nitrogen levels if managed sustainably. However, large-scale production may lead to pesticide use, which requires careful management.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Storage and Shelf Life</td>

<p>Assumption: By-products contribute an additional ₹15,000 - ₹35,000 in revenue per year.</p>

<h2>Profit Calculation</h2>
<p>Using a range approach (minimum to maximum):</p>

<div class="section-title">Total Revenue (including by-products):</div>
<ul>
    <li>Minimum: ₹40,000 + ₹15,000 = ₹55,000</li>

<div class="section-title">Net Profit Calculation:</div>
