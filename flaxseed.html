    <tr>
        <td>Storage and Shelf Life</td>
        <td>Flaxseed should be stored in a cool, dark place to prevent oxidation. Whole seeds can last up to a year, while ground flaxseed has a shorter shelf life.</td>

<p>Assumption: By-products contribute an additional ₹15,000 - ₹30,000 in revenue per year.</p>

<h2>Profit Calculation</h2>
<p>Using a range approach (minimum to maximum):</p>

<div class="section-title">Total Revenue (including by-products):</div>
<ul>
    <li>Minimum: ₹50,000 + ₹15,000 = ₹65,000</li>
    <li>Maximum: ₹1,00,000 + ₹30,000 = ₹1,30,000</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-title">Total Costs (initial + maintenance):</div>
<ul>
    <li>Minimum: ₹2,50,000 + ₹60,000 = ₹3,10,000</li>
    <li>Maximum: ₹4,00,000 + ₹90,000 = ₹4,90,000</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-title">Net Profit Calculation:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Minimum Profit: ₹65,000 - ₹3,10,000 = -₹2,45,000 (loss)</li>
