    <h2>Example Calculation</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Initial Cost per Acre: ₹3,50,000 - ₹6,00,000</li>
    <li>Maintenance Cost per Acre per Year: ₹70,000 - ₹1,20,000</li>
    <li>Olive Revenue per Acre per Year: ₹60,000 - ₹1,20,000</li>
    <li>Other Potential Income (from By-Products): Revenue from by-products such as olive oil, olive pomace, cosmetics, and animal feed, contributing ₹25,000 - ₹50,000 per year.</li>
</ol>

<p>Assumption: By-products contribute an additional ₹25,000 - ₹50,000 in revenue per year.</p>

<h2>Profit Calculation</h2>
<p>Using a range approach (minimum to maximum):</p>

<div class="section-title">Total Revenue (including by-products):</div>
<ul>
    <li>Minimum: ₹60,000 + ₹25,000 = ₹85,000</li>
    <li>Maximum: ₹1,20,000 + ₹50,000 = ₹1,70,000</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-title">Total Costs (initial + maintenance):</div>
<ul>
    <li>Minimum: ₹3,50,000 + ₹70,000 = ₹4,20,000</li>
    <li>Maximum: ₹6,00,000 + ₹1,20,000 = ₹7,20,000</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-title">Net Profit Calculation:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Minimum Profit: ₹85,000 - ₹4,20,000 = -₹3,35,000 (loss)</li>
