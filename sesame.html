<p>Assumption: By-products contribute an additional ₹20,000 - ₹40,000 in revenue per year.</p>

<h2>Profit Calculation</h2>
<p>Using a range approach (minimum to maximum):</p>

<div class="section-title">Total Revenue (including by-products):</div>
<ul>
    <li>Minimum: ₹45,000 + ₹20,000 = ₹65,000</li>
    <li>Maximum: ₹1,00,000 + ₹40,000 = ₹1,40,000</li>

<div class="section-title">Total Costs (initial + maintenance):</div>
<ul>
    <li>Minimum: ₹2,00,000 + ₹50,000 = ₹2,50,000</li>
    <li>Maximum: ₹3,50,000 + ₹80,000 = ₹4,30,000</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-title">Net Profit Calculation:</div>
<ul>
